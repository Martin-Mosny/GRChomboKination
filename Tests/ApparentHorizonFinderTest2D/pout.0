Parameter: max_spatial_derivative_order not found in parameter file. It has been set to its default value = 4.
Parameter: grid_buffer_size not found in parameter file. It has been set to its default value = 8.
Parameter: dt_multiplier not found in parameter file. It has been set to its default value = 0.25.
Parameter: fill_ratio not found in parameter file. It has been set to its default value = 0.7.
Parameter: num_extrapolating_vars not found in parameter file. It has been set to its default value = -1.
You are using non periodic boundary conditions.
The boundary params chosen are:  
---------------------------------
- Sommerfeld boundaries in direction high 1
The non zero asymptotic values of the variables in this direction are : 


- Reflective boundaries in direction low 1
The variables that are parity odd in this direction are : 
V
